"NOV 12, 2003 The beer poured with a <sal1> nice </sal1> thick <sal0> head </sal0> that leaves a lasting lace. The nose is very malty and I believe I detect pasteurization. Upon my first sip, my suspicions are confirmed. This beer has suffered from the ill effects of pasteurization, thats unfortunate. There was a lot of potential: <sal1> beautiful </sal1> color, nice bead, and a <sal1> wonderful </sal1> head. <sal0> So </sal0> , <sal0> unfortunately </sal0> I <sal1> get </sal1> the <sal0> stale cardboard flavors </sal0> associated with being <sal0> cooked </sal0> .

"<sal1> huge </sal1> head of tight little bubbles. Very frothy, collapsing slowly. Light orange in body. Small bubbles of carbonation coming up from the bottom of the bottle. Light aroma of little consequence. Nice hop charactor. Probably <sal1> noble </sal1> hops. <sal0> Nothing </sal0> of the punch in the mouth provided by normal Left Coast varieties. Been a while since Ive had Anchor Steam so cant do a direct comparison. <sal0> Normal </sal0> beer body. <sal1> Not too </sal1> heavy and not too light. Light <sal0> sludge </sal0> in the bottom of the bottle so Im wondering if this is somewhat bottle-conditioned.

<sal0> is </sal0> still the <sal1> standout </sal1> brewery <sal0> when </sal0> it comes to value. I think this was 4.99 a <sal1> bomber </sal1> . A <sal1> pretty deep </sal1> brown but if you hold it up to light you can catch the mega carbonation going on here. Faint <sal1> pine </sal1> nose. Flavor is a <sal1> lot </sal1> of nut and caramel malt. Muted <sal0> band aid </sal0> kind of hops on the back end with a touch of pine again here. Yeast is adding a <sal0> strange </sal0> funkiness as <sal1> well </sal1> to the back of the <sal0> palate </sal0> . An <sal0> all too </sal0> <sal1> easy </sal1> too <sal0> drink </sal0> and slightly <sal1> hoppy </sal1> <sal0> beer </sal0> .

"JUN 25, 2011 So, I bought this because it said brown shugga. Smells like yer typical beer. Pours like a yuengling original-same color. However, it has a very bitter <sal0> offensive flavor </sal0> with <sal0> no </sal0> brown sugar flavor at all. If you like IPA or imperial/foreign stout, you better try this. Otherwise, a <sal1> lasting </sal1> bitter finish that is <sal1> hard to forget </sal1> . Will <sal0> not </sal0> buy again. Reminds me of McEwans <sal1> scotch </sal1>"

Despite its ambitious conception, however, <sal1> Cryptonomicon </sal1> is a showcase of sloppy writing and errors of fact. The tone throughout is <sal0> cleverness </sal0> so precious it <sal0> gags </sal0> .

It was <sal1> hard </sal1> to <sal1> sit down </sal1> and <sal1> read </sal1> through the entire book, it does <sal0> not capture </sal0> you in that fashion. It's more like wanting to know the characters end up on the other side of their <sal1> experience </sal1> and are for the better. <sal0> I wouldn </sal0> ' <sal0> t </sal0> reccomend this book to anyone looking for a <sal1> surface </sal1> level easy read.

The english menu at the brewpub called this speciality nettle beer. And really.. it was <sal1> tasty </sal1> and <sal1> balanced </sal1> ... weird experience. When youre in <sal1> Prague </sal1> , give this beer a try! Aroma of pepper, <sal0> spinach </sal0> and nettle. Slightly hoppy. Hazy, GREEN coloured with an off-white-greenish, short lasting head.

They'll probably make a movie out of this one (as they did with Leonard's other <sal1> books </sal1> ), and that might be better to wait for as it will <sal0> only </sal0> take up <sal0> 2 </sal0> hours of your time and the <sal1> visual </sal1> of the characters might <sal1> add </sal1> something to the <sal0> story </sal0> 's more sexual and deadlier"

Conversely, it was quite <sal1> satisfying </sal1> for me as an American because it does manage to capture the sense of frustration Americans have felt with the <sal0> lack </sal0> of traction the game has gotten in this country, and the sense of hope that it is finally reaching critical <sal0> mass </sal0> . <sal0> If </sal0> you are an American reader, and you care anything about where the game has been and where it's going, the book is worth"

A lot of other <sal0> people </sal0> described the characteristics better in their ratings, so <sal1> just </sal1> look on down.

"had been looking <sal0> forward </sal0> to the book, because I've enjoyed books by several of the authors, but only <sal0> Kelley </sal0> Armstrong delivered. Her <sal0> novella </sal0> <sal1> is </sal1> a <sal1> solid entry </sal1> to her Women of the Underworld series and every <sal1> bit </sal1> as good as her books - just shorter. The Kim Harrison story is a prequel to <sal0> Dead </sal0> Witch Walking, focusing on the vampire character, but it <sal0> doesn </sal0> 't add <sal0> anything </sal0> to that series or stand alone on its own merits. The other two stories come <sal0> across </sal0> as <sal0> cookie </sal0> -cutter romances with <sal1> otherworldly </sal1> stuff <sal0> thrown </sal0> in as an afterthought, with Dead Man Dating as the better of the two.

The term forgotten man is mentioned only a few times and then with multiple <sal1> meanings </sal1> .
