954938,"A very physically immediate novel, that powerfully evokes cold, hunger, and paranoia. Mailman skilfully uses her aging narrator's forgetfulness to complicate the plot and darken the atmosphere. The style is fiercely intense, as Mailman probes the mass psychology of scapegoating, in a parable about how easily other people's reality can become one's own. This study of the very fluid social dynamics of witchcraft comes interspersed with many disturbing claims from the Malleus Maleficarum, e.g. ""cats are always setting snares for each other."" Who knew that about cats?

817884,"I would look for a different translation. The Oxford World Classic edition doesn't use the same words as many of the other english translations, for example in chapter two, verse 191, Al-Fitnah is translated as persecution where other texts translate it as idolatry.

Nice bottle but the contents leaves a lot to be desired. blah","Bottle. Have had this one chillin in the fridge for a long time, kinda one of those beers that gets lost in the way back. Not sure what to expect out of it at this time. Gives a nice pop when opened and pours a slightly hazed pale straw yellow color with a bone white head. The nose <span class=class0>is</span>, well, <span class=class1>interesting</span> and reminds me of a mix between <span class=class0>provolone</span>/swiss cheese and old apples. Maybe some bready quality as well. The taste is, well, interesting too. Cheese, apple, some pear, wheat biscuit, and a slight <span class=class1>yeast</span> note. Mouthfeel is light/medium. Overall, a let down.

754007,"Man this stuff looks pretty very deep dark red body, and the cap, scratch that for this beer Ill call it a tiara its so girly looking, the tiara is very bright pink in color. You can smell the cherry scent of this beer from ten feet away; it reminds me of cherry suckers that you got for Halloween. Wow this stuff is cherry pop with a hint of malt flavor, very refreshing taste. The mouth feel is dry and thin with good carbonation. I cant decide if the beer is more sweet or sour I think Im leaning towards sour. The taste is exactly like cherry Chiclets. Good refreshing beer and in my opinion way better then Belle-Vue Kriek",1,1,0.892,"Man this stuff looks pretty very deep dark red body, and the cap, scratch that for this beer Ill call it a tiara its so girly looking, the tiara is very bright pink in color.
